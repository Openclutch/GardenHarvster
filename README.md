# Neon Drift Duo

Neon Drift Duo is a fast arcade-inspired 2‑player cooperative browser game. Build a retro street racing garage, install neon-soaked mods, and bank credits together. Everything runs in the browser with no external assets — all visuals are drawn procedurally on a `<canvas>` element.

## How to Play

* **Movement:** Player 1 uses `WASD`, Player 2 uses the arrow keys.
* **Actions:** `E` (P1) / `/` (P2) works the current bay, `Q` / `.` swaps to the next mod kit, number keys select specific kits.
* **Objective:** Buy kits at the Parts Vendor, install them in your own bays, then cash out finished builds at the Race Terminal. Keep bays clear — overheated builds must be purged for ₵250.
* **Events & Crew:** Watch the Street Feed (`H`) for time-limited boosts. Charge the plaza spotlight to recruit unique crew members with powerful perks.

Drop-in touch controls are included for mobile play. A second player can join at any time from the top-right button.
